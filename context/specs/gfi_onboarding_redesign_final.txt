## STAGE 3: Week 3 Onboarding
**Duration:** 8 hours  
**Short Description:** Prepare for field training and build confidence.

### Task 3.1: Qualify Your List with MACHO
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Short Description:** Learn to identify and prioritize your best prospects using the Three-Part Test.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

**What this means:**  
Lead qualification helps you decide who to focus on first—so you get the best results for the time you spend prospecting. The Three-Part Test identifies which leads are most likely to need what you offer and are ready to take action. This strategic approach prevents you from wasting time on low-probability contacts.

**What you'll do:**  
Profile each lead in your list using MACHO fit, Connection Level, and Timing indicators.

**How to do it:**  
1. **Start with Your Warm Network:**
   - These are people you already know something about
   - These people already care about you
   - They're more open to conversation than strangers
   - Your first step: announce your new career and rebrand yourself as someone who helps families protect their future
   - This alone sparks conversations

2. **Understand the Qualification Test:**
   - **3 Good Qualities** – What are the three qualities that would make them a good business partner?
   - **MACHO Fit** – Do they have 3 or more MACHO traits (Married, Age > 30, Children, Homeowner, Occupation)?
   - **Connection Level** – How well do you know them?
   - **Timing** – Have they indicated an interest in meeting?

3. **Discuss with AI:** 
   — After profiling your leads, ask the AI Assistant:
   - "Which of my leads should I prioritize first?"
   - "Help me understand why this person is a good MACHO fit"
   - "How should I handle someone in my network with only 2 MACHO traits?"

**What you'll achieve:**  
You'll have a prioritized, qualified list showing exactly who to contact first, building confidence while you learn and creating early success stories.

### Task 3.2: Learn the ETHOR Script
**Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Short Description:** Master the Field Training Script for engaging your warm network with your trainer.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

**What this means:**  
The ETHOR method is your natural, pressure-free script for inviting people in your warm network to a conversation with you and your trainer. Your job is to spark curiosity—let your trainer do the explaining. This positions you as a professional while building support from people who already trust you.

**What you'll do:**  
Learn and practice the ETHOR script until it feels conversational and authentic.

**How to do it:**  
1. **Learn the ETHOR Framework:**
   - **E**xcited – Share your excitement about getting started
   - **T**raining – Let them know you're in training and need practice
   - **H**elp – Ask for their help, not a commitment
   - **O**pinion – Say you'd love their honest feedback
   - **R**eferral – Invite them to refer someone if it's not for them

2. **Master the Script** — Here's the proven conversation flow:

   **YOU:** "Hey how are you? (Small Talk). Well the reason I am calling is because I just took a position with [Company Name], and I'm super excited about it. I'm actually going through training right now and your support would mean the world to me. So I was wondering if you and [Spouse] would help me out?"

   **THEM:** "Of course, what would you need from us?"

   **YOU:** "All we would do is hop on a quick Zoom in the next day or so where my trainer will share with you what we are and what I'll be doing in my new career path so I can learn, but also, that way if you ever come across anyone who would benefit from what we do, you can have confidence referring them to me. So what day works better for you both, tomorrow or the next day?"

3. **Critical Rule: Always Call, Never Text** 
   - Texts don't convey enthusiasm
   - Calls build connection
   - Your voice matters

4. **Practice with AI:** - After practicing, ask the AI Assistant:
   - "Let's role-play the ETHOR script"
   - "How can I sound more natural?"
   - "What if they say they're too busy?"

**What you'll achieve:**  
You'll confidently invite warm contacts to meet your trainer in a way that feels helpful, not salesy, and positions you for success.

**What you'll do:**  
Contact your top prospects, use the ETHOR script, and facilitate introductions to your trainer.

**How to do it:**  
1. **Start with Your Top 10** — Begin with contacts on your list who:
   - Have 4 or 5 MACHO attributes
   — AND a strong personal Connection with you

2. **Make the Contact** — Reach out using their preferred method:
   - Call, text, or in-person—whatever feels most natural
