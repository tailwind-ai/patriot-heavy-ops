         - Your budget (some providers offer GFI member discounts)

    instructions: |
      **What this means:**
      "Money. Wealth. Life Insurance." is the cornerstone text for understanding how life insurance creates wealth. Written specifically for agents, the first three chapters explain why life insurance isn't just a death benefit—it's a living financial tool that can help families build wealth, protect assets, and create tax-advantaged retirement income.
      
      **What you'll do:**
      Read Chapters 1-3 and absorb the core concepts that differentiate GFI's approach from traditional insurance sales.

         - Full PDF of Chapters 1-3 (approximately 40 pages)
         - Optional: Audiobook version if you prefer to listen
         - Summary notes highlighting key concepts

         - **Chapter 2**: How life insurance functions as a financial asset
         - **Chapter 3**: The Infinite Banking Concept basics
      
      3. **Take Notes** — Jot down:
         - Questions you have
         - Concepts you'll need to explain to clients
         - Personal "aha moments"
      
      4. **Discuss with AI** — After reading, ask the AI Assistant:
         - "Explain the key difference between money and wealth"
         - "How would I explain the Infinite Banking Concept to a friend?"
         - "Quiz me on Chapter 2"
      
      **What you'll achieve:**
      You'll understand the philosophical foundation of your future practice and be able to articulate why life insurance is a wealth-building tool.

    description: "Put yourself in your client's shoes and learn the discovery process that builds trust and uncovers needs."
    instructions: |
      **What this means:**
      Before you can help a client build wealth or protect their family, you need to understand where they're starting from. The Client Experience is about learning to see through your client's eyes—understanding their household finances, identifying protection gaps, and laying the foundation for comprehensive solutions. This task teaches you the discovery framework you'll use in every client meeting.
      
      **What you'll do:**
      Learn the discovery tools that drive meaningful client conversations, then complete a financial questionnaire as if you were the client.
      
      **How to do it:**
      1. **Ask Yourself the 5 Magic Questions** — Review the discovery questions and answer them for yourself:
         - These questions help clients articulate their goals, fears, and priorities
         - Answer them honestly as if an agent were asking you
         - Experience firsthand what your clients will experience
         - This builds empathy and helps you understand what information matters most
      
      2. **Complete Your Own Financial Questionnaire** — Now put yourself in the client's seat:
         - Click "Complete Financial Questionnaire"
         - Answer every question as if you were meeting with an agent
         - This deepens your understanding of the client journey
      
      **What you'll achieve:**
      You'll understand the discovery process from both sides of the table and be prepared to gather meaningful information from clients.

      **What you'll achieve:**

    description: 'Use proven triggers to recall another 100-200 names you initially forgot.'
    instructions: |
      **What this means:**
      Most agents think they're done after writing 100 names, but memory joggers help you recall another people you initially overlooked. This task uses psychological triggers—like looking at your phone contacts, social media friends, and old photos—to unlock additional names.
      
      **What you'll do:**
      Go through a series of memory-jogging exercises to expand your Fantasy Team list.
      
      **How to do it:**
      1. **Phone Contacts Scan** — Open your phone contacts and scroll through:
         - Anyone you've called/texted in the last 6 months
         - People you forgot to add to your initial list
         - Add them now (target: +20 names)
      
      2. **Social Media Scan** — Log into Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram:
         - Scroll your friends/connections list
         - Look at people who engage with your posts
         - Check "People You May Know" suggestions
         - Add them to your list (target: +20 names)
      
      3. **Discuss with AI** — After scanning, ask the AI Assistant:
         - "Jog my memory to help me build my list."
      
      **What you'll achieve:**
      You'll have 100-200 names—more than enough to fuel your agency launch.

    description: 'Take and pass your state insurance licensing exam (so you can get paid!).'
    instructions: |
      **What this means:**
      This is the major milestone of Week 2: passing your state exam and becoming a licensed insurance agent. By now you've completed your pre-licensing course. This task is about exam prep, test-taking strategy, and executing on exam day.
      
      **What you'll do:**
      Complete final exam preparation, take your scheduled exam, and celebrate when you pass!
      
      **How to do it:**
      1. **Day Before Your Exam:**
         - Confirm your exam appointment
         - Get good sleep each night
         - Use the AI Assistant to quiz you: "Give me 10 practice questions on [topic]"
         - Review exam logistics: location, what to bring, arrival time
         - Review your wrong answers to understand why
      
      2. **Exam Day:**
         - Arrive 30 minutes early
         - Bring two forms of ID (including one government-issued photo ID)
         - Don't bring: phones, smart watches, food/drinks
         - Take your time—you have 2-3 hours
         - Trust your first instinct on questions you're unsure about
      
      3. **After the Exam:**
         - You'll get your results immediately (pass/fail)
         - If you pass: Celebrate! Take a screenshot. Report back to the team.
         - If you don't pass: It's okay—many agents need multiple attempts. Book your retake immediately less than week later.
      
      **What you'll achieve:**
      You'll be a licensed insurance agent, legally able to earn commissions as a financial services professional.

    name: 'Qualify Your List with MACHO'
    type: 'ASSIGNMENT'
    estimatedDuration: 45
    description: 'Learn to identify and prioritize your best prospects using the Three-Part Test.'
    instructions: |
      **What this means:**
      Lead qualification helps you decide who to focus on first—so you get the best results for the time you spend prospecting. The Three-Part Test identifies which leads are most likely to need what you offer and are ready to take action. This strategic approach prevents you from wasting time on low-probability contacts.
      
      **What you'll do:**
      Profile each lead in your list using MACHO fit, Connection Level, and Timing indicators.
      
      **How to do it:**
      1. **Start with Your Warm Network:**
         - These are people you already know something about
         - These people already care about you
         - They're more open to conversation than strangers
         - Your first step: announce your new career and rebrand yourself as someone who helps families protect their future
         - This alone sparks conversations
      
      2. **Understand the Qualification Test:**
         - **3 Good Qualities** – What are the three qualities that would make them a good business partner?
         - **MACHO Fit** – Do they have 3 or more MACHO traits (Married, Age > 30, Children, Homeowner, Occupation)?
         - **Connection Level** – How well do you know them?
         - **Timing** – Have they indicated an interest in meeting?
      
      3. **Discuss with AI:**
         - After profiling your leads, ask the AI Assistant:
         - "Which of my leads should I prioritize first?"
         - "Help me understand why this person is a good MACHO fit"
         - "How should I handle someone in my network with only 2 MACHO traits?"
      
      **What you'll achieve:**
      You'll have a prioritized, qualified list showing exactly who to contact first, building confidence while you learn and creating early success stories.

    estimatedDuration: 30
    description: 'Master the Field Training Script for engaging your warm network with your trainer.'
    instructions: |
      **What this means:**
      The ETHOR method is your natural, pressure-free script for inviting people in your warm network to a conversation with you and your trainer. Your job is to spark curiosity—let your trainer do the explaining. This positions you as a professional while building support from people who already trust you.
      
      **What you'll do:**
      Learn and practice the ETHOR script until it feels conversational and authentic.
      
      **How to do it:**
      1. **Learn the ETHOR Framework:**
         - **E**xcited – Share your excitement about getting started
         - **T**raining – Let them know you're in training and need practice
         - **H**elp – Ask for their help, not a commitment
         - **O**pinion – Say you'd love their honest feedback
         - **R**eferral – Invite them to refer someone if it's not for them
      
      2. **Master the Script** — Here's the proven conversation flow:
      
         **YOU:** "Hey how are you? (Small Talk). Well the reason I am calling is because I just took a position with [Company Name], and I'm super excited about it. I'm actually going through training right now and your support would mean the world to me. So I was wondering if you and [Spouse] would help me out?"
      
         **THEM:** "Of course, what would you need from us?"
      
         **YOU:** "All we would do is hop on a quick Zoom in the next day or so where my trainer will share with you what we are and what I'll be doing in my new career path so I can learn, but also, that way if you ever come across anyone who would benefit from what we do, you can have confidence referring them to me. So what day works better for you both, tomorrow or the next day?"
      
      3. **Critical Rule: Always Call, Never Text**
         - Texts don't convey enthusiasm
         - Calls build connection
         - Your voice matters
      
      4. **Practice with AI:** - After practicing, ask the AI Assistant:
         - "Let's role-play the ETHOR script"
         - "How can I sound more natural?"
         - "What if they say they're too busy?"
      
      **What you'll achieve:**
      You'll confidently invite warm contacts to meet your trainer in a way that feels helpful, not salesy, and positions you for success.

    instructions: |
      **What this means:**
      This is where you take action. Using your qualified list and ETHOR script, you'll start contacting people and introducing them to your trainer. Your trainer will use the 3 Good Qualities and MACHO attributes to create a connection and set a meeting.
      
      **What you'll do:**
      Contact your top prospects, use the ETHOR script, and facilitate introductions to your trainer.
      
      **How to do it:**
      1. **Start with Your Top 10** — Begin with contacts on your list who:
         - Have 4 or 5 MACHO attributes
         - AND a strong personal Connection with you
      
      2. **Make the Contact** — Reach out using their preferred method:
         - Call, text, or in-person—whatever feels most natural
         - Use the ETHOR script as your guide
         - Focus on reconnecting first, then transition
      
      3. **Send Group Text with Your Trainer:**
         - After they agree to meet, send a three-way text introducing your trainer
         - Your trainer will take over scheduling
      
      **What you'll achieve:**
      You'll make your first real introductions, see professional conversations in action, and start building momentum toward your 3-3-60 goals.
