# Repository Analysis History

This folder contains timestamped analysis reports from the `/analyze-repo` command.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`

Example: `2025-10-07-143000.md`

## What Gets Stored

Each analysis file contains:
- Timestamp of analysis
- Detected deployment method
- Detected database/schema
- Detected CI/CD configuration
- Test frameworks and linters
- Changes applied to config files
- Notes and observations

## Usage

The `/analyze-repo` command automatically creates a new timestamped file each time it runs.

Review past analyses to track how your repository configuration has evolved over time.
