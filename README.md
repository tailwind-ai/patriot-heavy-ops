### üìñ Foundation Projects

**[Taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/taxonomy)** - Modern Next.js 13 Application Template  
An open source application showcasing Next.js 13's latest features including App Router, Server Components, and modern React patterns. Taxonomy provides the architectural foundation for Patriot Heavy Ops with its comprehensive implementation of authentication, database integration, and full-stack TypeScript patterns. The project demonstrates best practices for building scalable, maintainable applications with modern tooling.

**[shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui)** - Beautiful & Accessible Component Library  
A collection of copy-and-paste components built on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. These components form the entire UI foundation of Patriot Heavy Ops, providing accessible, customizable, and beautifully designed interface elements. The library's approach of providing source code rather than a package dependency gives us full control over styling and behavior while maintaining consistency and accessibility standards.

**[T3 Stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)** - Full-Stack TypeScript Development  
The T3 Stack provides type-safe environment management and development patterns that ensure robust, maintainable code. Patriot Heavy Ops leverages T3's `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` for environment variable validation and follows T3's opinionated approach to full-stack TypeScript development, ensuring type safety from database to UI.

These open source foundations save months of development time by providing battle-tested patterns, components, and architecture, allowing us to focus on what makes Patriot Heavy Ops unique - connecting contractors with military-trained heavy equipment operators.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
  This React framework provides server-side rendering and static site generation for Patriot Heavy Ops. It powers the entire application architecture with App Router and API routes. The main configuration for Next.js can be found in `next.config.mjs`.
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  This JavaScript library builds the interactive user interfaces for Patriot Heavy Ops, including contractor dashboards, operator profiles, and service request forms. The React components are located in the `components/` and `app/` directories.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  This typed superset of JavaScript ensures code reliability and maintainability across Patriot Heavy Ops. TypeScript definitions and configurations can be found in `tsconfig.json` and type definitions in the `types/` directory.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Validation

Per `.cursorrules.md` standards, all code changes must pass validation before committing:

```bash
# Manual validation (run before every commit)
npm run validate

# Docker-based validation (recommended for consistency)
npm run validate:docker

# Or use the validation script directly
./scripts/validate-pre-commit.sh
```

The validation process includes:
- **TypeScript type checking**: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **ESLint code quality**: `npx eslint . --quiet`

### Local CI Simulation

Before pushing changes, simulate the CI environment:

```bash
# Run all tests in Docker environment
docker-compose exec app npm test

# Full validation pipeline
docker-compose exec app npm run validate && docker-compose exec app npm test
```

### Type Safety Standards

This project enforces strict type safety:
- **Zero `any` types allowed** - Use proper TypeScript types
- **Unused parameters** - Prefix with underscore (`_unused`)
- **Optional chaining required** - Use `obj?.prop` for uncertain data
- **Error boundaries** - Wrap uncertain operations in try-catch blocks
