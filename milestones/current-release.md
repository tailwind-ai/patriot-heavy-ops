## Notes

This release is a strategic pause to establish content marketing infrastructure before pushing core marketplace features. Blog content will help:
1. Attract organic traffic from contractors and operators
2. Establish trust and authority in the military-to-civilian construction space
3. Improve SEO for target keywords
4. Provide resources for both contractors and operators

The blog integration was completed efficiently using Outstatic's Git-based approach, which aligns well with our existing development workflow.
